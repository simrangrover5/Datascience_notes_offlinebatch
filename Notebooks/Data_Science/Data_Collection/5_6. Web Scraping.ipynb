       "<p>Hi My name is Alin Parashar and I am currently working in DeCurtis Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd. as DevOps and Network Engineer. My story starts from GRRAS till reaching here. Initially, I heard about linux but was not aware how can it push you on a high level in your career. One of my friend introduced me to Mr. Ravi Saraswat who is co-founder of GRRAS Solutions Pvt. Ltd. and also my mentor who guided me on how I can enter in Linux field and what are its advantages. The first impression from him literally clarifies my all doubts about how dedicated and knowledgeable he is in this field. That made me confident enough to be a part of this Institute. I started with RHCSA and later completed RHCE under Mr.Ravi Saraswat, Now when you are working on your technical skills , you also have to work on your personality and other important perspectives because this makes you even better , so I got softskills classes here .Now looking at my potential and ability, GRRAS offered me to be part of them as an online instructor which helped me in completing more certification and also helped me upgrading myself in new technologies coming in IT industry. This vision was a part of my mentor that he saw in me which I really appreciate. With the vision and guidance of Ravi Sir, I am here today in-front of you and telling you my successful ride till here. I really want to thank GRRAS for the guidance and support, supporting me in every aspect of this amazing journey.</p>\n",

       " <p>After studying at GRRAS for more than 2months, I certainly felt that the environment which GRRAS provides is wonderful for students. Every-one is friendly and co-operative. I have never seen such an environment anywhere else. All the trainers are ready to help students anytime. The training helped me to crack my interview at ACCENTURE as they asked me some technical questions related to LINUX which I was able to answer in a shot because of this training. I feel grateful for being a part of GRRAS FAMILY. I heartily thank GRRAS for their tremendous support.</p>\n",

       " <p>Hi My name is Alin Parashar and I am currently working in DeCurtis Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd. as DevOps and Network Engineer. My story starts from GRRAS till reaching here. Initially, I heard about linux but was not aware how can it push you on a high level in your career. One of my friend introduced me to Mr. Ravi Saraswat who is co-founder of GRRAS Solutions Pvt. Ltd. and also my mentor who guided me on how I can enter in Linux field and what are its advantages. The first impression from him literally clarifies my all doubts about how dedicated and knowledgeable he is in this field. That made me confident enough to be a part of this Institute. I started with RHCSA and later completed RHCE under Mr.Ravi Saraswat, Now when you are working on your technical skills , you also have to work on your personality and other important perspectives because this makes you even better , so I got softskills classes here .Now looking at my potential and ability, GRRAS offered me to be part of them as an online instructor which helped me in completing more certification and also helped me upgrading myself in new technologies coming in IT industry. This vision was a part of my mentor that he saw in me which I really appreciate. With the vision and guidance of Ravi Sir, I am here today in-front of you and telling you my successful ride till here. I really want to thank GRRAS for the guidance and support, supporting me in every aspect of this amazing journey.</p>\n",
